## Identification and Classification of Orphan Genes, Spurious Orphan Genes, and Conserved Genes in the human microbiome


This work advances methods for orphan gene discovery and demonstrates that expressed orphan genes differ systematically from conserved genes and spurious orphan genes in sequence composition, structural constraints, and evolutionary signals.
